        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Hammed Ibrahim Olamide, a passionate Frontend Engineer who
          believes in the power of clean code and exceptional user experiences.
          My journey in technology began with curiosity and has evolved into a
          deep commitment to creating digital solutions that make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          With expertise in JavaScript, React.js, TypeScript, and modern CSS, I
          specialize in translating complex design concepts into intuitive,
          accessible, and performant web applications. I'm driven by the belief
          that great software is not just about functionality, but about
          creating experiences that users love.

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          While I'm confident in my core frontend skills, there are areas where
          I recognize the need for growth:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Advanced Testing Strategies:</strong> While I understand
            basic testing concepts, I want to master complex testing scenarios,
            mocking, and test-driven development practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance Optimization at Scale:</strong> I'm comfortable
            with basic optimization, but want to learn advanced techniques for
            large-scale applications and complex performance bottlenecks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility Deep Dive:</strong> While I implement basic
            accessibility features, I want to become an expert in WCAG
            guidelines and advanced accessibility patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Backend Integration:</strong> I'd like to better understand
            how frontend applications interact with various backend
            architectures and APIs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DevOps and Deployment:</strong> Understanding CI/CD
            pipelines, containerization, and deployment strategies for frontend
            applications.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <div class="future-note">
          <p>
            <strong>Dear Future Hammed,</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            As you read this, remember why you started this journey. You chose
            to pursue excellence in frontend development because you believe in
            creating digital experiences that matter. Don't lose sight of that
            passion.
          </p>
          <p>
            You've always been someone who learns by doing, who asks questions,
            and who isn't afraid to fail. Keep that spirit alive. Every bug you
            fix, every feature you build, and every user you help is a step
            toward becoming the developer you aspire to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember: it's not about knowing everything, but about being curious
            enough to learn anything. Stay humble, stay hungry, and most
            importantly, stay kind to yourself and others in this journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Keep building, keep learning, keep growing.</em>
          </p>
        </div>

      <section data-testid="test-about-extra" class="about-section">
        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Technology is more than just code; it's about solving real-world
          problems and making people's lives better. I'm excited about the
          future of web development, particularly:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The evolution of Web Components and their potential to revolutionize
            component architecture
          </li>
          <li>
            Progressive Web Apps and their ability to bridge the gap between web
            and native experiences
          </li>
          <li>
            Artificial Intelligence integration in frontend development tools
          </li>
          <li>
            The growing importance of performance and sustainability in web
            applications
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I believe that the best developers are those who never stop learning,
          who embrace change, and who always put the user first. This program is
          just another step in that lifelong journey of growth and discovery.
